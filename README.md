# FYP-MentalHealthAI
Final Year Project at Undergraduate
This will be an AI based mental health assistant, it will assist in diagnosing mental health conditions and helping people to manage theirs. 
It will provide suggestions and helpful advice based off what the user inputs. 
Other assistants are very limited in their capabilities plus a mobile version of this could be very beneficial for younger people who find it harder to share with people.

Software used:
Excel,
RStudio,
Trello,
GitHub

The Project is amde up of a few key aprts, these being the text analysis, the AI and the UI.
The UI is not a key focous so is meant to be simple to understand and easy to sue for everyone.
The Text analysis is meant to be a small part of the project and is implemented to read the diary entry and create a profile for the entry.
Finally the AI uses a Decision tree to attempt to find any POSSIBLE condiitons that may be present in the entry that has been analyzed.
All of these are just possible conditions and are not meant to be taken as an alternative to professional help.
The project is a proof of concept for further development adn work in the area and could be built and improved upon in the future.
